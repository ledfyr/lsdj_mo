LSDJ MIDI out handler for Raspberry Pi
This program provides Arduinoboy-like functionality for LSDJ MIDI out mode.
MIDI out is sent using a USB MIDI device connected to the Raspberry Pi. Device is selected when starting the program from command line.

RPi - GB pin connections:
GPIO-2 - GB clock, GPIO-0 - GB serial out, RPi GND - GB GND

COMPILE
For regular Raspbian:
make

For RT kernel:
make rt

RUN
Use default delay values:
sudo ./lsdj_mo

Use custom delay values:
sudo ./lsdj_mo <byte_delay> <bit_delay> <before_read_delay>

STATUS:
MIDI notes are often "missed". The Arduino seems more stable, or there are bugs in my code :(
